<h4>Pitch a game idea : pre-introduction phase></h4>
The game's concept is a level-based game in which you control the main character's movements and attacks. There will be a variety of enemies to contend with. Some will simply move around at random, while others will attack you directly. To advance to the next level, you must either avoid or eliminate them.
The game takes place in the middle of the ocean, when a stranded traveller and his crew perish in a boat catastrophe. He is stranded on an island where terrible monsters prowl the area. Knowing that his pals are in peril on this island, he sets out to find them. He was also required to acquire a particular amount of objects in order to restore his ship while assisting in the search to rescue of his crew.
The captain of the ship, Eli, is the main character. He is a fearless and powerful pirate with a deep bond with his crew. He wields a sword and a side arm, both of which he employs as self-defence weapons. He is the leader of a small crew, but his men are extremely devoted and important to him. As a result, he makes every effort to save them.
I am looking for a teammate that is passionate and skilled at his work. Mainly someone who can mix work and fun because this project sounds fun and I want it to be an enjoyable experience.
I was inspired by the show “One Piece” and my first created game “Ball Escape”.
